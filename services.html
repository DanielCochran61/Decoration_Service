        1 Room   2 Rooms   3 Rooms 
        
        $30        $50            $70 
        
        This package does not involve any other purchases. We will just review your space and I will give you advice on how to make your room more organized and how to bring some of the pieces you already have together and make some suggestions on some DIY projects that could help turn your space around. Great deal for a low budget or if you’re just needing some guidance. 
        
        With this package, I am available for 1 month after I have sent your 3D model and my list of suggestions. This allows for any questions or concerns or further guidance to ensure your space gets completed. I will then send an email confirming our time together has ended and hopefully I can receive “after” photos of your space! 
        
        Package B 
        
        1 Room   2 Rooms   3 Rooms 
        
        $60         $110         $150 
        
        With this package I will go over your room with you and I will research items and send the ones that I find will fit the design we agree on and you can purchase them to complete your space. I will also help incorporate pieces you already have and give advice on how to complete your space. All within the budget you decide. I do all the work for you. You just make the purchases and send me your before and after photo. 
        
        With this package, we will have 6 weeks to work together after I have sent your list of items to purchase. This allows for any questions or concerns or further guidance to ensure your space gets completed. I will then send an email confirming our time together has ended and hopefully I can receive “after” photos of your space! 
         
        Package C 
        
        1 Room   2 Rooms   3 Rooms 
        
        $100       $160         $200 
        
        If you just want a nice space, but are too busy, or don’t want the hassle, then this package is for you. I will help come up with a design for your space, use pieces you already have if needed and I will shop for items to fit your space.  I will send you the items I've chosen, whatever you agree on, I will send you a full cost summary of everything to be bought and you only pay one more time after paying for your initial package request. You don’t have to go on multiple websites or visit multiple stores to gather your items. I take care of the purchasing process and have everything shipped to your home while you relax and wait for your items. This option also allows me to physically go out and shop for your space and find one of a kind items for you in my local antique shops. 
        
        With this package, we will have 6 weeks to work together after I have ordered your items. This allows for any questions or concerns or further guidance to ensure your space gets completed. I will then send an email confirming our time together has ended and hopefully I can receive “after” photos of your space!  </p>
