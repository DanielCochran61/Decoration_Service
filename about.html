    <p class="text-center">HI THERE! 

        My name is Callie Cochran. I’m 28 years old, married with 2 kids. I have been on a long journey to find a career I love. Trying to follow the guidance of the Lord, but most of the time I can think so loud I can’t hear anything else. Something I try to work on. I’ve tried many things over the years on the side of my regular job and nothing seemed to fit just right. For about a year I decided to not try anything. Just see if anything would come to the surface. After lots of reflecting, I finally pieced together the common thing between all my previously “great ideas”. My favorite part was the shopping and placing the final product in its place. That’s where I found the most joy. It wasn’t the building it or crafting it in between, it was seeing how it completed a room or made someone happy. Then it was like everything I ever thought finally made sense and what I wanted to do was obvious. I wanted to decorate! And organize because I love that too. I love the idea of a clean, bright, organized space. A room that looks so awesome you don’t want to leave because you just keep staring at everything around you. After years and years this is how CLASSIE finally came to be. I’m so excited to be on this journey to help people feel great about their homes which I hope turns into happiness in their lives.  </p>
